# Manufacturing_Analysis
I show how we can handle a typical manufacturing data analytics problem of machine/tester drift and benchmark using very simple Python analytics tools.

The idea is to just show the possibilities so that engineers, working in the manufacturing sector or on Industry 4.0 initiatives, can think beyond the box and embrace data science tools and techniques in their analytics work.
